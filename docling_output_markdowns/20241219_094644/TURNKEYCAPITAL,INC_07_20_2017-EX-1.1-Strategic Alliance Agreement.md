## 1. Overview

The purpose and intent of this strategic alliance is to combine the resources and talents of, TKCI and SIC, in order to take advantage of every opportunity permitted by tribal sovereignty to create revenue streams in multiple areas in conjunction with operating partners that have existing marketing and customers in place, thereby limiting the capital requirements and risk.
